  * Username-based authentication
* Static pages (e.g. "About", "Terms") that are manageable by admins and written in Markdown
* Admin interface via [Active Admin](http://activeadmin.info/)
* Site settings (e.g. site name, site slogan) via [Settingslogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/settingslogic)
